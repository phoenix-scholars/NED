\chapter{نوع داده‌}

%    Each of the sections that follow describes a data type defined in the
%    XDR standard, shows how it is declared in the language, and includes
%    a graphic illustration of its encoding.

در این بخش انواع داده‌های از پیش تعریف شده در استاندارد ند تشریح شده است.
هر ساختار داده با استفاده از شکل گرافیکی تشریح شده است که بیانگر نحوه ذخیره سازی
آن در جریان داده است.
 
%    For each data type in the language we show a general paradigm
%    declaration.  Note that angle brackets (< and >) denote variable-
%    length sequences of data and that square brackets ([ and ]) denote
%    fixed-length sequences of data.  "n", "m", and "r" denote integers.
%    For the full language specification and more formal definitions of
%    terms such as "identifier" and "declaration", refer to Section 6,
%    "The XDR Language Specification".
%
%    For some data types, more specific examples are included.  A more
%    extensive example of a data description is in Section 7, "An Example
%    of an XDR Data Description".

% 4.20.  Areas for Future Enhancement
% 
%    The XDR standard lacks representations for bit fields and bitmaps,
%    since the standard is based on bytes.  Also missing are packed (or
%    binary-coded) decimals.
% 
%    The intent of the XDR standard was not to describe every kind of data
%    that people have ever sent or will ever want to send from machine to
%    machine.  Rather, it only describes the most commonly used data-types
%    of high-level languages such as Pascal or C so that applications
%    written in these languages will be able to communicate easily over
%    some medium.
% 
%    One could imagine extensions to XDR that would let it describe almost
%    any existing protocol, such as TCP.  The minimum necessary for this
%    is support for different block sizes and byte-orders.  The XDR
%    discussed here could then be considered the 4-byte big-endian member
%    of a larger XDR family.
