% 4.3.  Enumeration
\section{شماره}

%    Enumerations have the same representation as signed integers.
%    Enumerations are handy for describing subsets of the integers.
%    Enumerated data is declared as follows:
% 
%          enum { name-identifier = constant, ... } identifier;
% 
%    For example, the three colors red, yellow, and blue could be
%    described by an enumerated type:
% 
%          enum { RED = 2, YELLOW = 3, BLUE = 5 } colors;
% 
%    It is an error to encode as an enum any integer other than those that
%    have been given assignments in the enum declaration.
