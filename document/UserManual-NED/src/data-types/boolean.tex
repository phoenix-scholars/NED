% 4.4.  Boolean
\section{دودویی}

%    Booleans are important enough and occur frequently enough to warrant
%    their own explicit type in the standard.  Booleans are declared as
%    follows:
% 
%          bool identifier;
% 
%    This is equivalent to:
% 
%          enum { FALSE = 0, TRUE = 1 } identifier;
