% 4.5.  Hyper Integer and Unsigned Hyper Integer
\section{صحیح بزرگ بدون علامت}

%    The standard also defines 64-bit (8-byte) numbers called hyper
%    integers and unsigned hyper integers.  Their representations are the
%    obvious extensions of integer and unsigned integer defined above.
%    They are represented in two's complement notation.  The most and
%    least significant bytes are 0 and 7, respectively.  Their
%    declarations:
% 
%    hyper identifier; unsigned hyper identifier;
% 
% 
%         (MSB)                                                   (LSB)
